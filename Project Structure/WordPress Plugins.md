# WordPress Plugins

We developed a Yeoman generator that permits scaffolding the plugin.

The generator has some sub-generators to enable the scaffolding of *Taxonomies*, *Custom Post Types*, *Widgets* and so on. 

Please refer to the [github repo](https://github.com/log-oscon/generator-log-wp-plugin).

The usage of a generator allows greater consistency between projects and to avoid repeating boring tasks.

**The usage of the generator is mandatory**
