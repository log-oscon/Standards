# Naming Conventions

When creating repositories it's important to keep the names informative and with a structure similar between projects. This hopefully helps to navigate among a growing base of repositories.

## Naming Repositories

The names should be a coupled maximisation of name lenght and information. The base structure should be composed of up to 3 words:

```
[client]-[specific_project]-[extension_key]
```

* `[client]` – Your client's acronym or abbreviation.
* `[specific_project]` – The name (preferably and acronym or abbreviation as well) for the project in question.
* `[extension_key]` – Extra information that allows for severals repositories to share the same base name when there a greater modularity. Bellow is a list of some keywords and their significance:
  * `frontend` – This is the repository that contains the front end code.
  * `api` – This contains an API or API related code.
