# Testing

We are proponents of **Test-Driven Development**. 

For this process we use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and the awesome [WordPress API Mocking Framework](https://github.com/10up/wp_mock) developed by 10Up.

### What to Test ?

> I used to feel that a ‘unit’ was the smallest possible part of a code base (a method, really). But in the past couple of years I’ve changed my mind. Here’s how I define a unit test, as of October 2011:
>
> A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes a unit of work in the system and then checks a single assumption about the behavior of that unit of work.
>
> A unit of work is a single logical functional use case in the system that can be invoked by some public interface (in most cases). A unit of work can span a single method, a whole class or multiple classes working together to achieve one single logical purpose that can be verified.
