# Version Control

## [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
BitBucket is a service by Atlassian. Although it permits public and private repositories, we use it solely as a private Git.


## [GitHub](https://github.com/log-oscon)
GitHub does not need introductions. We use it as our public repository, where all our open-source projects are stored.


## GUI
If you need an helper to avoid GIT instructions via terminal/console, we advise you to try [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).
