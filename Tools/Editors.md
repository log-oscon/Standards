## Editors

We don't prescribe an IDE or text editor at log, developers are welcome to use whatever suits them best.

However, if you _do_ use any of the editors below (which we recommend, because they're awesome), then you are encouraged to install a few extensions to make your life easier and integrate with our tools and processes.

### [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

Sublime Text is a cross-platform text and source code editor, with a Python application programming interface (API). Sublime Text is proprietary software. Its functionality is extendable with plugins. Most of the extending packages have free-software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Sublime Text lacks graphical setting dialogues and is entirely configured by editing text files.

Sublime Text can be equipped with a package manager called [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) that allows the user to find, install, upgrade and remove plug-ins, usually without restarting Sublime Text. The package manager keeps installed packages up-to-date with an auto-upgrade feature and downloads packages from GitHub, BitBucket and a custom JSON-encoded channel/repository system.

If Sublime Text is your editor of choice, then we recommend the following extensions:

* [CodeFormatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CodeFormatter)
* [DocBlockr](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DocBlockr)
* [EditorConfig](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/EditorConfig)
* [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter)
* [SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint)
* [SublimeLinter-jshint](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-jshint)
* [SublimeLinter-phpcs](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-phpcs)

### [JetBrains PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)

PhpStorm is a commercial cross-platform PHP and web IDE developed by JetBrains. PhpStorm provides on-the-fly code analysis, error prevention and automated refactorings for PHP and JavaScript code, and offers out-of-the-box support for WordPress projects.

All features available in WebStorm are either already included in PhpStorm, or available as free plugins. No additional purchase is necessary to use PhpStorm to develop in JavaScript.
