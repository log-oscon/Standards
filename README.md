# log's Standards

Yes, we have those!
This repository is the collection of all the standard practices we employ at our [*beloved company*](http://log.pt). It is a work in continuous progress and, hopefully, it will always be better yet never finished.
This is our vision on things, and in all cases it is a mix of several sources and experience, which is itself a mix of other sources. Of the 0.001% of "originality" that you may find here, consider it our gift to you.

We have a simple site in the hoven to make things more *pretty* and readable. But in the mean time feel free to browse the repository and read whatever you feel like.

## Contributions

Contribuitons are most welcome in their natural form of Pull Requests, the following guidelines are just to keep things following with ease:
* If it's something new, make sure it's not hidden somewhere in here already or that we didn't dismiss it for something else.
* Make sure you supply some arguments for the benefits/advantages your change provides.
